  <p>There's a certain comfort, and often inherent cool, in things categorized as "retro". A '69 Ford Mustang. A greaser pompadour. Betty White. Pixel Design.</p>

  <h2>The lost meduim of pixel art.</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Manually dithering via infinite tonal variations to simulate depth</li>
    <li>Stacking pixel units of a shape's outline convervatively, to avoid "jaggies: and smooth edges</li>
    <li>Faux anti-aliasing of harsh edges via the six the available non-alpha-transparent grey switches</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    <p>We as The Dead Pixel Society honor the humble pixel with icon creations we would have done had we continued designing these 18 years, under the exact same archaeic constraints: 256 colors, pixel-by-pixel, on a 32x32 canvas.</p>
